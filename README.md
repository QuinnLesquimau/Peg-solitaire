# Peg solitaire
An implementation of Peg solitaire in Python. You can use multiple different boards (but
you have to implement them directly in the code (that's just a matrix, not complicated) or
to create them in god mode).
You can go back and forth in history of the moves by pressing the left and right arrow keys.
You can enter god mode by pressing the 'g' key and modify the board.
You can compute a solution, if there is one, by pressing 's'.
You can test if there is a pagoda function proving that there is no solution by pressing 't'.
You can compute a solution faster by pressing 'r', but sometimes it can miss a solution.
